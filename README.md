# mee6-level-bypasser
Uses a webhook to ping you when someone passes you on a mee6 leaderboard.


**DO NOT USE FOR BIG DISCORD SERVERS**
The "API" just grabs the top 100 people on the scoreboard and looks if your user is there. It won't work if you aren't in the top 100. There's not much that can be done about this without being rate limited. Maybe I'll work on a solution later...
